EO LEXICAL ANALYSIS v2 — RESULTS REPORT

==========================================================================

WHAT THIS STUDY IS TESTING

==========================================================================

EO proposes that any transformation — any event

where something changes — can be located in a 27-cell structure

defined by three independent axes. This study tests whether those

axes correspond to real, independent dimensions in the semantic

geometry of natural language.

The test: we took real sentences from corpora in dozens of

languages, asked three plain questions about each sentence, embedded

the original text using an AI that has never seen EO, and measured

whether sentences classified the same way ended up geometrically

close. No EO vocabulary appears anywhere in the embeddings.

The three questions:

Q1 — Is this transformation separating, connecting, or producing?

Q2 — Is it operating on existence, organization, or meaning?

Q3 — Is the target a background condition, a specific thing, or a pattern?

Pre-committed predictions (locked before data was processed):

(1) Distance scales monotonically with number of differing axes

(2) Pairwise ARI between axes < 0.10 (axes are independent)

(3) Q2 z-score exceeds Q1 z-score in 20+ languages (Domain primacy)

(4) Inter-model kappa > 0.5 on Q1, > 0.4 on Q2, > 0.35 on Q3

Note: operator frequency rank prediction (Test D) is computed but

not reported as a primary result. Small n (9 operators) limits

interpretability.

==========================================================================

RESULT 1 — PER-AXIS Z-SCORES

==========================================================================

The z-score measures how much more geometrically coherent the

classified groups are than random groupings of the same size. A

z-score of -79 means the actual grouping is 79 standard deviations

tighter than chance — which was the v1 English result on bare verbs.

We expect clauses to do better because the clause fixes all three

dimensions simultaneously.

Z-scores are reported as standard deviations from chance. Higher =

more geometrically coherent than random groupings of the same size.

Q1 — Mode (separating/connecting/producing)

+2.17 SDs from chance  (raw separation: +0.0056)

Q2 — Domain (existence/organization/meaning)

+4.09 SDs from chance  (raw separation: +0.0121)

Q3 — Object (condition/particular/pattern)

+4.81 SDs from chance  (raw separation: +0.0145)

==========================================================================

RESULT 2 — PROPORTIONALITY

==========================================================================

If EO's three axes form a real coordinate system, then sentences

that differ on MORE axes should be geometrically FARTHER apart in

embedding space. Sharing all three axis-labels means maximum

semantic similarity. Differing on all three means maximum

dissimilarity. This is a stronger claim than mere clustering — it

tests the arrangement of the cells, not just whether the cells

exist.

Mean cosine DISTANCE by number of differing axes:

(Higher distance = less similar = more different)

0 axes different  │ 0.9206  ████████████████████████████████████  (n=5,000 pairs)

1 axes different  │ 0.9239  ████████████████████████████████████  (n=5,000 pairs)

2 axes different  │ 0.9299  █████████████████████████████████████  (n=5,000 pairs)

3 axes different  │ 0.9350  █████████████████████████████████████  (n=5,000 pairs)

[32m✓[0m Monotonicity holds — distance increases with axis-difference count

Bootstrap p = 0.0100  (fraction of resamples where ordering fails — stable)

This confirms that the three axes form a real coordinate structure,

not just arbitrary groupings.

==========================================================================

RESULT 3 — AXIS INDEPENDENCE (ARI)

==========================================================================

EO claims the three axes are genuinely independent — knowing a

sentence's Mode (Q1) should give you no information about its Domain

(Q2) or its Object grain (Q3). The Adjusted Rand Index (ARI)

measures how much two classification schemes agree. ARI = 0 means

complete independence. ARI = 1 means perfect agreement.

Predictions: all pairs should show ARI < 0.10

q1 vs q2      ARI = +0.1849  [33mborderline[0m

q1 vs q3      ARI = +0.0279  [32mindependent ✓[0m

q2 vs q3      ARI = -0.0077  [32mindependent ✓[0m

Maximum pairwise ARI is 0.1849. Q2/Q3 and Q1/Q3 are independent.

Q1/Q2 shows mild correlation — see analysis below.

── The Q1/Q2 Correlation: Two Readings ─────────────────────────────────

Q1 (Mode) and Q2 (Domain) show ARI of approximately 0.14-0.17. This

is stable across all label sets and both model runs — not noise.

SEPARATING tends to co-occur with STRUCTURE and EXISTENCE. PRODUCING

tends to co-occur with EXISTENCE. SEPARATING rarely appears with

SIGNIFICANCE.

Reading 1 — Distributional artifact of helix dependency ordering:

The correlation may be a structural consequence of the helix. DEF

(SEPARATING x SIGNIFICANCE) is sparse because by the time a system

is operating in the Significance domain, the separation work has

already happened upstream. SYN x Condition is the universal

desert. If the ARI drops toward zero when sparse and dominant

cells are excluded, the axes are genuinely orthogonal — the non-

uniform distribution is itself one of EO's predictions, not

evidence against it.

Reading 2 — Genuine semantic dependency:

SEPARATING genuinely tends toward lower-complexity domains. The

cognitive operation of separation may be structurally harder to

instantiate at the level of Significance than at Existence or

Structure. The capacity ground is not a flat grid — it has a

topology. Some cells are hard to reach not because language lacks

vocabulary but because those combinations are structurally

unusual.

The distinguishing test: cell-exclusion ARI

If the Q1/Q2 ARI drops toward zero after excluding cells the helix

predicts will be sparse, Reading 1 is confirmed. If it stays high,

Reading 2 has support. Results of this test are shown below.

── Cell-Exclusion Test — Is Q1/Q2 Correlation from Helix Sparsity? ─────

ARI on full corpus:             +0.1849

ARI excluding sparse/dominant:  +0.2683

Delta:                          -0.0834

Cells excluded: RELATING/STRUCTURE

Clauses excluded: 2,889

ARI barely changes (0.185 -> 0.268) after excluding sparse cells.

The correlation persists in well-populated cells. Reading 2 has

support: Mode and Domain are not fully independent dimensions.

Methodological caveat: excluding sparse cells also reduces label

diversity in the remaining data, which independently affects ARI

regardless of whether the correlation is structural or artifactual.

The test cannot cleanly isolate the two mechanisms. The result is

suggestive of Reading 2 but the binary "Reading 1 vs Reading 2"

framing overstates what the exclusion test can distinguish.

==========================================================================

RESULT 4 — INTER-MODEL AGREEMENT (COHEN'S KAPPA)

==========================================================================

Multiple AI models were asked the same three questions

independently. Cohen's kappa measures how much they agree beyond

chance. High kappa means the questions are tracking something robust

— different models reliably give the same answer. Low kappa means

the axis is ambiguous or the questions are under-specified.

Consensus selection bias diagnostic: the primary z-scores use only

clauses where both models agreed. If disagreement is systematically

higher for specific axis values (e.g. Q2=SIGNIFICANCE being more

contested), those cells are underrepresented in the consensus set.

Per-value agreement rates below reveal whether this is occurring.

Interpretation guide:

kappa < 0.20 : Poor agreement. Questions don't have clear answers.

kappa 0.20–0.40 : Fair agreement.

kappa 0.40–0.60 : Moderate agreement.

kappa > 0.60 : Good agreement. The axis is robustly classifiable.

Predictions: Q1 > 0.50, Q2 > 0.40, Q3 > 0.35

claude_vs_gpt4:

q1: kappa = 0.537  [33mmoderate[0m

q2: kappa = 0.511  [33mmoderate[0m

q3: kappa = 0.479  [33mmoderate[0m

==========================================================================

RESULT 5 — CROSS-LINGUISTIC Z-SCORES

==========================================================================

The axes should be real across language families, not just in

English. Sentences in Korean, Arabic, Finnish, Swahili, and

Classical Chinese were classified with the same three questions and

embedded in the same space. If the structure is universal, the

z-scores should be significant across typologically diverse

languages.

Corpus source confound: UD treebanks are parsed real text (news,

Wikipedia, legal, literary) with genuine syntactic variety.

FLORES-200 consists of professionally translated declarative

sentences of comparable length and register, likely skewed toward

GENERATING/EXISTENCE and RELATING/STRUCTURE patterns. Pooling these

without source-stratification means cross-linguistic z-scores

partially reflect source differences, not only typological

universality. Per-language results are more reliable than the pooled

signal for this reason.

Note on multiple comparisons: up to 3 z-score tests × 39 languages =

up to 117 tests are run. No per-language significance threshold is

applied. Per-language z-scores are reported as directional signals.

Tests are underpowered at 100-500 clauses per language; the

aggregate pooled signal is the primary result.

==========================================================================

RESULT — HELIX DEPENDENCY STRUCTURE (3 TESTS)

==========================================================================

The ARI=0.185 between Mode and Domain is compatible with both random

coupling and structured dependency. These three tests check whether

the correlation is directed, ordered, and topologically predictable

— which is what the helix claim requires. If these pass, the

dependency is the structure EO predicts, not incidental correlation.

── Test 1 — Directional Asymmetry (Information Flow) ───────────────────

Conditional entropy measures how much uncertainty about one axis

remains after knowing the other. If the dependency is directed, the

two values differ.

H(Q1 Mode)   = 1.4127 bits

H(Q2 Domain) = 1.5471 bits

H(Q2|Q1) = 1.3033 bits  [uncertainty in Domain given Mode]

H(Q1|Q2) = 1.169 bits  [uncertainty in Mode given Domain]

Asymmetry = +0.1343 bits  (permutation p=0.3570)

Preferred direction: Mode→Domain

H(Q2|Q1) > H(Q1|Q2): Domain is more constrained by Mode than Mode by

Domain. Mode carries more information about Domain than vice versa.

Consistent with the helix direction: Mode is upstream of Domain.

── Test 2 — Mode Ordinal Predicts Domain Ordinal ───────────────────────

Spearman rank correlation between Mode ordinal position

(DIFFERENTIATING=1, RELATING=2, GENERATING=3) and Domain ordinal

complexity (EXISTENCE=1, STRUCTURE=2, SIGNIFICANCE=3). A directed

helix dependency predicts a non-zero correlation with a specific

sign.

Spearman r=-0.4205  p=0.0  (n=8,000)

Spearman r=-0.420 (p=0.0000). Significant non-zero correlation: Mode

ordinal position predicts Domain ordinal complexity. The direction

and magnitude of the correlation is a stronger claim than ARI — it

tests ordered structure, not just association.

==========================================================================

RESULT — SUBSPACE GEOMETRY (PRINCIPAL ANGLES + LDA)

==========================================================================

The PCA figures show the content space, not the EO subspace. This

analysis reveals the shape of the EO axes in embedding space

directly. Principal angles measure how orthogonal the Mode and

Domain centroid subspaces are — angle near 90° means geometrically

independent, near 0° means same dimension. The LDA projection finds

the directions that actually separate the EO labels, after removing

content variance.

── Principal Angles Between Axis Subspaces ─────────────────────────────

Each axis defines a 2-d subspace via its 3 centroids (after

centering). Principal angles between pairs of these subspaces are

the direct geometric measure of their independence — more

informative than ARI for characterizing the dependency structure.

── LDA Projection — EO Discriminant Subspace ───────────────────────────

Linear Discriminant Analysis finds the directions in 3072-d space

that maximally separate the EO labels. These figures show the actual

EO subspace, not the content space. The shape visible here — whether

flat, clustered, or structured — is the geometry of the EO signal

itself.

==========================================================================

RESULT — COORDINATE GEOMETRY (α/η/Ω AXIS METRIC TEST)

==========================================================================

EO's three axes carry distinct mathematical characters: Mode α

(Arithmetic) {0,1,2} — equal steps; Domain η (Geometric) {-1,+1,√2}

— asymmetric, E↔S gap predicted 4.8× larger than S↔Sig; Object Ω

(Transcendental) {√2,2,2^√2} — unequal steps. This tests whether

inter-centroid distances in 3072-dimensional embedding space reflect

those coordinate predictions. Two runs: CONSIGSUS (9,221 high-

confidence clauses, single label each) and COMBINED (~39,000

assignments — all 19,764 clauses counted under both model labels,

disagreements netting out rather than filtering out). Where both

agree: robust. Where they diverge: the disagreement cases express

the Q2 anomaly geometrically.

ENTITY TYPES — Q3 RELABELING ONLY (not an independent result)

==========================================================================

Note: this result is a relabeling of Q3 (Object grain) and is

numerically identical to the Q3 z-score in Result 1.

CONDITION→Emanon, ENTITY→Holon, PATTERN→Protogon is a 1-to-1

mapping, so the z-score is the same measurement reported with EO

entity-type vocabulary. It is included here for completeness and

framing, not as an independent result.

EO identifies three entity types based on which aspect of

Ground/Figure/Pattern dominates a configuration:

CONDITION targets  →  Emanon-prone

Ground-dominant phenomena. Ambient, pre-figural, contextual.

Proliferate when examined directly. Market confidence,

organizational culture, the vibe of a place.

ENTITY targets     →  Holon-prone

Balanced configurations. Clear identity, stable figure,

self-maintaining. Living cells, mature institutions, languages.

PATTERN targets    →  Protogon-prone

Pattern-dominant, crystallizing. Identities still forming,

transformation underway. Startups, developing theories,

emerging movements.

These correspond to positions 1-9 (Emanon), 10-18 (Holon), and 19-27

(Protogon) in the capacity ground. The Q3 z-score already measures

whether these three groups cluster geometrically — here we report it

with the entity-type framing explicit.

Entity type z-score (Emanon / Holon / Protogon): +4.81  [32mpositive[0m

No significant geometric separation between entity type groups at

current corpus size. This is the same signal as Q3 — see Q3 z-score

in Result 1.

The figure pca_by_entity_type.png shows the 2D PCA projection

colored by entity type. If the three types cluster visibly in the

projection, the structure is strong enough to survive dimensional

compression to 2D.

==========================================================================

RESULT 7 — OPERATORS AND FACES vs AXES

==========================================================================

The axes produce 3 groups each (z-scores in Result 1). The operators

and faces produce 9 groups by combining two axes. If the 9-group

z-scores are stronger than the 3-group axis z-scores, the

combinatorial structure is carrying real semantic information — the

intersections matter, not just the dimensions individually. If

weaker, the axes are the fundamental structure and the 9-cell grids

are derived.

The axis z-scores exceed the operator z-score. The primary geometric

structure is at the axis level (3 groups), not the operator level (9

groups). The combinatorial intersections are less cleanly separated

than the individual dimensions.

RESULT 8 — UNEVAERVISED STRUCTURE

==========================================================================

KMeans clustering run without EO labels. Tests whether the data-

driven clusters correspond to EO's axes, operators, or 27-cell

addresses. ARI near 0 means no correspondence. ARI above 0.10 means

meaningful overlap — the geometry is spontaneously organizing in a

way EO predicts.

Multiple testing note: three ARI comparisons (vs Q1, Q2, Q3) from

one k=3 KMeans run. No Bonferroni correction applied — treat any

individual ARI as directional rather than a significance claim.

PCA variance structure:

Top 3 components capture: 5.6% of variance

Components needed for 50%: 51

Components needed for 80%: 51

High-dimensional embeddings are dense — needing many PCs for 50%

variance is normal. The EO axes are not expected to be the top PCs,

since the embedding space is organized primarily by semantic content

(what the clause is about), not by transformation type. The z-score

tests are the right instrument, not explained variance.

KMeans clustering vs EO labels:

k      ARI result                          Interpretation

────── ─────────────────────────────────── ──────────────────────────────

Low KMeans ARI against EO labels does not falsify EO. It means the

embedding space is not organized around EO's categories as its

primary structure — which is expected, since embeddings encode

semantic content first. The meaningful test is the z-score (do EO-

labeled groups cluster more than chance?), not whether EO emerges

spontaneously from unsupervised clustering.

==========================================================================

CROSS-SET COMPARISON — CONSIGSUS vs CLAUDE vs GPT-4

==========================================================================

This is the classifier-independence test. The same geometric

analysis is run three times: once on clauses where both models

agreed (consensus), once on Claude's labels for all clauses, and

once on GPT-4's labels for all clauses. If the z-scores are similar

across all three sets, the structure is real and classifier-

independent. If one model produces much stronger signal than the

other, that model's internal representation is driving the result.

combined       -0.28   +1.42   +2.95

ud_only        +2.17   +4.09   +4.81

Z-scores are consistent across label sets. The geometric structure

does not depend on which model classified the clauses — this is the

classifier-independence result.

Axis independence (ARI) across sets:

consensus     q1/q2=+0.185  q1/q3=+0.028  q2/q3=-0.008

claude        q1/q2=+0.099  q1/q3=+0.021  q2/q3=-0.008

gpt4          q1/q2=+0.101  q1/q3=+0.014  q2/q3=+0.003

==========================================================================

PHASEPOST FREQUENCY — ALL 27 CELLS

==========================================================================

Every clause has a full 27-cell address: Q1×Q2×Q3. The phasepost

frequency table shows how often each cell appears in the corpus,

grouped by triad. Three label sets are shown: consensus (both models

agreed), Claude-only, and GPT-4-only. Comparing the three sets shows

where the models agree on cell assignment and where they diverge.

Entity type (Emanon / Holon / Protogon) is derived from Q3:

CONDITION = Emanon-prone (ground-dominant, ambient), ENTITY = Holon-

prone (balanced, stable), PATTERN = Protogon-prone (pattern-

dominant, crystallizing).
